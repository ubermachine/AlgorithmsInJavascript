# **Sorting**

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a list of elements in a certain order.

Another term that is mostly heard with these sorting algorithms is Stable/Unstable algorithms.  
Stable algorithms are those that do not change the position of occurance of similar elements from their previous order.

Most commonly known sorting algorithms are-  
1. Bubble Sort  
1. Insertion Sort  
3. Selection Sort  
4. quick Sort  
5. Merge Sort  
6. Heap sort  
7. Radix Sort  
8. Shell Sort
  
Out of these algorithms Merge sort,quick sort,Heap sort and shell sort algorithms are said to be efficient sorting algorithms with average Big O of (n log n)
